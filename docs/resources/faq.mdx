## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="What is klaw?">
    klaw is enterprise AI agent orchestration — like kubectl, but for AI agents.

    ```bash
    klaw get agents          # List all agents
    klaw describe agent      # Inspect an agent
    klaw logs agent          # View logs
    klaw cron create         # Schedule tasks
    ```

    If you know kubectl, you already know klaw.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Why 'kubectl for AI Agents'?">
    Because the operational challenges are identical:

    | Challenge | Kubernetes | klaw |
    |-----------|------------|------|
    | Where does my workload run? | Scheduler → Nodes | Dispatcher → Nodes |
    | How do I isolate workloads? | Namespaces | Namespaces |
    | How do I configure them? | ConfigMaps/Secrets | Config/Secrets |
    | How do I monitor them? | `kubectl logs` | `klaw logs` |
    | How do I schedule work? | CronJob | `klaw cron` |

    Kubernetes solved this for containers. klaw solves it for AI agents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Who is klaw for?">
    Enterprises running AI agents in production. If you have multiple agents doing different jobs (lead scoring, competitor monitoring, support automation, report generation) and need:
    - Visibility into what agents are doing
    - Isolation between teams
    - Scheduling and automation
    - Easy scaling

    klaw is for you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Is klaw production-ready?">
    klaw is in public beta. It's being used in production by early adopters. Expect some rough edges before 1.0.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Comparison

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="How is klaw different from OpenClaw?">
    OpenClaw is powerful but complex:
    - Node.js + multiple services
    - Difficult deployment
    - Hard to scale

    klaw is a single Go binary with:
    - Same agent capabilities
    - kubectl-style operations
    - Deploy in seconds
    - Scale by adding nodes

    Think of klaw as "OpenClaw, but simple."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="How is klaw different from LangChain/CrewAI?">
    Those are **frameworks for building agents** — they help you chain LLM calls together.

    klaw is **infrastructure for operating agents** — it helps you deploy, schedule, monitor, and scale those agents in production.

    You could build agents with LangChain and deploy them on klaw.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="How is klaw different from Google ADK?">
    ADK provides abstractions for building agents. klaw provides the runtime and control plane for running them. Different layers of the stack.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="How is klaw different from Claude Code?">
    Claude Code is a single-user interactive coding assistant.

    klaw is multi-agent orchestration for enterprises — multiple agents, multiple teams, namespaces, scheduling, Slack control, distributed mode.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="What LLM providers are supported?">
    300+ models via:
    - **each::labs Router** — single API for all models
    - **OpenRouter** — multi-provider gateway
    - **Direct providers** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Azure
    - **Local models** — Ollama, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Is this about sandboxing agents?">
    **Partial.** Namespaces provide *logical* isolation:
    - **Scoped secrets** — sales can't access support's API keys
    - **Tool permissions** — agents only get the tools you allow
    - **Resource isolation** — each namespace is independent

    **However:** Non-containerized agents have **no filesystem sandboxing**. They run under your user account and can access any file you can.

    **For true sandboxing, use Podman containers:**
    ```bash
    klaw run myagent --task "..."
    ```

    Containers provide process isolation, filesystem restrictions, and network controls.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Can I run klaw on-prem?">
    Yes. Single binary, no external dependencies. Run on your servers, your VPC, air-gapped environments. You control everything.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="How does distributed mode work?">
    1. Start a controller on one machine
    2. Worker nodes join the cluster
    3. Tasks are automatically dispatched to available nodes

    ```bash
    # Controller
    klaw controller start --port 9090

    # Workers
    klaw node join controller:9090 --token $TOKEN

    # Dispatch
    klaw dispatch "analyze leads" --agent lead-scorer
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Do I need Docker or Kubernetes?">
    No. klaw is a single binary with no external dependencies. You can optionally use Podman for containerized agents, but it's not required.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="What's the difference between `klaw chat` and `klaw start`?">
    - `klaw chat`: Interactive CLI session for one user
    - `klaw start`: Full platform with Slack integration, cron scheduler, and multi-user support
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="How do I control agents from Slack?">
    1. Set up Slack bot and app tokens
    2. Run `klaw start`
    3. Use `@klaw` in Slack

    ```
    @klaw status              # List agents
    @klaw run lead-scorer     # Trigger agent
    @klaw logs ticket-handler # View logs
    ```

    See [Slack Integration Guide](/guides/slack-integration) for full setup.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Can I schedule recurring tasks?">
    Yes. Use the cron system:
    ```bash
    klaw cron create daily-report \
      --schedule "0 9 * * *" \
      --agent reporter \
      --task "Generate daily status report"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="How do agents communicate with each other?">
    Agents can spawn sub-agents using the `agent_spawn` tool, share context through workspace files, or communicate via Slack channels in team deployments.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deployment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="What are the system requirements?">
    - Any 64-bit Linux, macOS, or Windows
    - ~20MB disk space for the binary
    - Internet access for LLM API calls (unless using local models)

    That's it. No runtime dependencies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="How do I update klaw?">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://klaw.sh/install.sh | sh
    ```
    The installer always gets the latest version.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Can I run klaw in containers?">
    Yes. klaw supports running agents in isolated Podman containers:
    ```bash
    klaw build
    klaw run myagent --task "..."
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="What's the difference between clusters and namespaces?">
    - **Cluster**: Top-level isolation (per organization)
    - **Namespace**: Sub-division within a cluster (per team/project)

    Similar to Kubernetes: namespaces provide logical isolation within a cluster.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Are my API keys secure?">
    API keys are stored in environment variables or config files. They're never sent to klaw servers—all LLM calls go directly to the provider.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="What can agents access on my system?">
    **Important:** Non-containerized agents run under the same user as the klaw process with **no filesystem restrictions**. They can access any file your user can access (including `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, etc.).

    By default, agents can:
    - Read/write **any files** your user can access
    - Execute bash commands with your user's permissions
    - Make web requests

    **For filesystem isolation, run agents in Podman containers:**
    ```bash
    klaw run myagent --task "..."
    ```

    Containers provide actual sandboxing. Non-containerized agents should be treated like any process running under your user account.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="How do I restrict agent permissions?">
    Configure namespaces in `~/.klaw/config.toml`:

    ```toml
    [namespace.sales]
    secrets = ["HUBSPOT_KEY"]
    allowed_tools = ["hubspot", "web_search"]

    [namespace.support]
    secrets = ["ZENDESK_KEY"]
    allowed_tools = ["zendesk", "slack"]
    ```
  </Accordion>
