## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="What is klaw?">
    klaw is an open-source platform for deploying and managing AI agents at scale. It brings Kubernetes-style orchestration to AI agents—same familiar patterns, but for intelligent agents instead of containers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Why is it called klaw?">
    "klaw" represents the tool that lets you grab and control AI agents, similar to how kubectl lets you control Kubernetes. It's also a nod to the Kubernetes ecosystem (k8s, k3s, etc.).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="How is klaw different from LangChain or CrewAI?">
    - **Single binary**: No Python setup, no dependencies
    - **Distributed by design**: Built-in controller-node architecture
    - **Multi-channel**: Native Slack integration, not just CLI
    - **Production-ready**: Namespaces, RBAC, observability built-in
    - **300+ models**: Any LLM through unified API
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Is klaw production-ready?">
    klaw is currently in public alpha. It's being used in production by early adopters, but expect some rough edges and breaking changes before 1.0.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Installation & Setup

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="What are the system requirements?">
    - **OS**: macOS, Linux, or Windows (WSL2)
    - **Architecture**: amd64 or arm64
    - **Memory**: 256MB minimum, 1GB recommended
    - **Disk**: 50MB for binary
    - **Network**: Outbound HTTPS access
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Which LLM providers are supported?">
    - **Anthropic** (Claude): Direct API access
    - **OpenRouter**: 100+ models through gateway
    - **each::labs**: 300+ models unified API

    More providers coming soon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Do I need Docker or Kubernetes?">
    No. klaw is a single binary with no external dependencies. You can optionally use Podman for containerized agents, but it's not required.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="What's the difference between `klaw chat` and `klaw start`?">
    - `klaw chat`: Interactive CLI session for one user
    - `klaw start`: Full platform with Slack integration, cron scheduler, and multi-user support
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Can I use multiple agents?">
    Yes. Create multiple agents with different configurations, skills, and purposes. Use the orchestrator to route messages to the right agent automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="How do agents communicate with each other?">
    Agents can spawn sub-agents using the `agent_spawn` tool, share context through workspace files, or communicate via Slack channels in team deployments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Can I schedule recurring tasks?">
    Yes. Use the cron system:
    ```bash
    klaw cron create daily-report \
      --schedule "0 9 * * *" \
      --agent reporter \
      --task "Generate daily status report"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deployment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Can I run klaw in containers?">
    Yes. klaw supports running agents in isolated Podman containers:
    ```bash
    klaw build
    klaw run myagent --task "..."
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="How do I scale to multiple machines?">
    Use distributed mode:
    ```bash
    # On controller
    klaw controller start --port 9090

    # On workers
    klaw node join controller:9090 --token xxx
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="What's the difference between clusters and namespaces?">
    - **Cluster**: Top-level isolation (per organization)
    - **Namespace**: Sub-division within a cluster (per team/project)

    Similar to Kubernetes: namespaces provide logical isolation within a cluster.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Are my API keys secure?">
    API keys are stored in environment variables or config files. They're never sent to klaw servers—all LLM calls go directly to the provider.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="What can agents access on my system?">
    By default, agents can:
    - Read/write files in their working directory
    - Execute bash commands
    - Make web requests

    Limit access by restricting tools and using container mode.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="How do I restrict agent permissions?">
    1. Limit tools when creating agents
    2. Set a specific working directory
    3. Use container mode for isolation
    4. Configure orchestrator rules for routing
  </Accordion>
